# Welcome

These are my attempts at the 40 JavaScript project ideas listed by freeCodeCamp [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/). These projects were developed to improve my knowledge of basic front-end technologies (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript).

Each sub-directory contains a separate readme describing the project, and a description of what was learned and achieved during the development.
