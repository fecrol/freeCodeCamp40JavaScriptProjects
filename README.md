# Welcome

These are my attempts at the 40 JavaScript project ideas listed by freeCodeCamp [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/).

Each sub-directory contains a separate readme dscribing the project, and a description of what was learned and achieved during the development.
